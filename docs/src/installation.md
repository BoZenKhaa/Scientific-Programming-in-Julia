# [Installation](@id install)
In order to participate in the course, everyone should install a recent version of Julia together with some text editor of choice. Furthermore during the course we will introduce some best practices of creating/testing and distributing your own Julia code, for which we will require a GitHub account.

## Julia IDE
There is no one way to install/develop and run Julia, which may be strange users coming from MATLAB, but for users of general purpose languages such as Python, C++ this is quite common. As of 2020 the most widely adopted way is in combination with the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor, for which there is an officially supported Julia [extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/). Moreover this setup is the same as with our bachelor [course](https://github.com/JuliaTeachingCTU/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning), which has provided an extensive tutorial mainly in case of installation on Windows machines, [here](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/stable/installation/julia/). If you are using any other supported platform, you can use the guide as well replacing some steps with your system specifics (having the `julia` executable in path or as an alias is a plus). When deciding which version to download we recommend the latest stable release as of September 2022, `1.8.x`. 

Note that this setup is not a strict requirement for the lectures/labs and any other text editor with the option to send code to the terminal, such as Sublime Text, Vim+tmux or Atom will suffice (a major convenience when dealing with programming languages that support interactivity through a Read-Eval-Print Loop - REPL).

## GitHub registration & Git setup
As one of the goals of the course is writing code that can be distributed to others, we require a GitHub account, which you can create [here](https://github.com/) (unless you already have one). In order to interact with GitHub repositories, we will be using `git` client. For installation instruction (Windows only) see the section in the bachelor [course](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/dev/installation/git/).
