Welcome to our course *Scientific Programming in Julia*.

## Information about the course
- Teachers: Tomáš Pevný and Vašek Šmídl
- Labs: Niklas Heim and Jan Franců
- Credits: 4
- Format: 2+2
- Enrollment: search code [XXX](https://) in KOS
- Requirements for the course:
    - Homeworks (after every lab)
    - Final project on a topic agreed with the lecturers
- Grading: 60% final project defended at exam and 40% homework 
- Location: TBD

Some homeworks are harder than others, so each of them is rewarded with a
different amount of points:

| Homework | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  |

## What will we emphasize? / What will you learn?
The main goals of the course are the following: (make it longer? Split into two.)
- Think in Julia.
- Write extensible and reusable code.
- Dig deeper into your code with debugging and introspection
- Automatic Differentiation (AD) from scratch - the backbone of modern machine learning.
- Experience the power of code composability with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations - NeuralODEs.
