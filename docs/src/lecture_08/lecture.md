# Automatic Differentiation

## Motivation

## Theory

### Forward

### Reverse

### Implementation
- TensorFlow with explicit graph vs. PyTorch with tape / Wengert list

### Mixing forward and reverse

### How to test
A tricky example with odd function

## Tricks

### Invertible functions
save on checkpointing

### Invertible functions
implicit functions

### ChainRules
- Why you want to have it
- Syntax
- Structural vs Natural gradient
