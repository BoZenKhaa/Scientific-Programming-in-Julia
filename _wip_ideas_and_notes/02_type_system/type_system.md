### The power of Type System \& multiple dispatch
  - Zero cost abstraction the compiler has information about types and can freely inline
    `x |> identity |> identity |> identity |> identity |> identity`
  - Why the type system is important for efficiency
  - Bad practices 
  - **LABS:**
      + Number type-tree
      + Design Interval Aritmetics (for ODES)
