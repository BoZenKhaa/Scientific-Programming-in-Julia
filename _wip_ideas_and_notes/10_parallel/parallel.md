### Different levels of parallel programming (SIMD, Tasks, Threads, Processes)
  - Paralellizing stochastic gradient descend
  - **LABS:**
    + Speeding up a simple sum of an array (start with simd and work our way up)
    + embarrassingly parallel example: asteroid belt around a sun (NBody simulation)
    + PDE? discretize by space patches, DistributedArrays.jl?
