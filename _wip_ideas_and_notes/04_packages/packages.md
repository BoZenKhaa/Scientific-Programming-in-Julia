### Packages
	* How package is structured
	* What to do if two packages implements the function with the same name. Is it intentional (stealing) or unintentional, which means you need full referencing.
	* Package dependencies are enforced and usede
	* Using interface defining packages, AbstractChainRules, LearnBase, StatsBase.s
	* What are environments
	* How to write unit tests and why (lack of interface enforcement)
	* How to write documentation?
	* Inner constructors

### Packages, environments, testing, continuous integration, dependency
  - **LABS:**
    + Create a package for interval arithmetic (github, unit tests, tomls, compat)
    + CI is important for debugging code and necessary
