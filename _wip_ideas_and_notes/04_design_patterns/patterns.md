### Design patterns: scoping / closure / opaque closures / interfaces / traits
  - Closure for abstraction
  - Lecture example: monitoring gradient descend.
    + function to create minibatch
    + callbacks for monitoring / early stopping / storing stuff / timed printing
  - How type system allows efficient closures (most of the time, there is no performance penalty)
  - The poor state of interfaces: traits
  - LABS
    + Small examples (GD?, Minibatching, )
    +  Performance issues ()
